## Java Paired Programming Exercise

### _Introduction:_

The Java Paired Programming Exercise is designed to assess a candidate's problem-solving skills and their comfort level with the Java programming language. Paired programming is a collaborative coding approach where two individuals work together to solve a problem or complete a programming task. This exercise provides a valuable opportunity for both the candidate and the interviewer to interact, exchange ideas, and assess the candidate's technical abilities in a real-time setting.

### _Objective:_

The primary objective of this exercise is to evaluate the candidate's proficiency in Java programming, problem-solving skills, and their ability to work effectively in a team. By pairing up with the candidate, the interviewer can gain insights into the candidate's thought process, coding techniques, and their ability to communicate and collaborate on a technical project.
